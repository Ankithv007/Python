# Python Exception Handling

Exception handling is an essential concept in Python programming that enables developers to gracefully handle errors and ensure the program continues executing smoothly without crashing unexpectedly. It separates error-handling code from normal program logic, improving both the reliability and readability of your code.

## Key Concepts

### 1. What is an Exception?

An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program's execution. When an unexpected situation occurs, such as dividing by zero or accessing a file that doesn't exist, Python raises an exception. The program will then stop execution unless the exception is handled properly.

### 2. `try-except` Block

A `try` block lets you write code that might raise an exception, while an `except` block lets you catch and handle those exceptions. The syntax is as follows:

```python
try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
    x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    # Code to handle the exception
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```
